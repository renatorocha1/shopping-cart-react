## ðŸ”– Project

This project was developed with the objective of implementing a simple shopping cart in react.

## Why did I decide to use Context?
For this situation the context provides a better way to provide the data in a global way for all components that need it and eventually avoid prop drilling.

## Why did I decide to use Styled Components?
Styled components provide a more semantic visual hierarchy to the code in addition to greater flexibility.

## Why did I decide to use HOC?
HOCs are a great way to reuse repeated logic in more components in a practical way, so I used the HOC `withPriceFunc` to pass functions that I will probably use a lot throughout the application.

## ðŸ¤” How to deploy it
In the project directory, you can run:
- Run the command `yarn install` or `npm install` to install the packages;
- Run the command `yarn start` or `npm start` to run the app in the development mode;
- Open `http://localhost:3000` to view it in your browser;
